# This Dockerfile is a placeholder for the ROS container.
# The base image (e.g., a ROS 2 Humble image) and build steps
# will be defined in a dedicated task.

# Example:
# FROM ros:humble-ros-base

# Set up the colcon workspace
# WORKDIR /ros_ws
# COPY . /ros_ws/src/robium
# RUN . /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && colcon build

# CMD ["ros2", "launch", "your_package", "your_launch_file.py"]

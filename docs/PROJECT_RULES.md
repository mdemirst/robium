# Project Rules

## Commit Workflow

- **After completing each subtask, a commit must be made.**
  - This ensures that each logical unit of work is tracked and can be reviewed or reverted independently.
  - The commit message should reference the subtask and summarize the work completed.
  - This rule applies to all contributors and all subtasks, regardless of size or complexity.

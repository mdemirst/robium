Create User model class in packages/backend/src/models/User.ts with:\n   - Static methods for CRUD operations (create, findById, findByEmail, update, delete)\n   - Password hashing using bcryptjs (12 rounds as per security standards)\n   - Input validation using Joi schemas\n   - Proper error handling with custom error types\n\n2. Key methods to implement:\n   - User.create(userData): Hash password, validate input, insert to database\n   - User.findById(id): Retrieve user by UUID\n   - User.findByEmail(email): Retrieve user by email (for login)\n   - User.update(id, updates): Update user data with validation\n   - User.delete(id): Soft or hard delete user\n   - User.validatePassword(password, hash): Compare password with hash\n\n3.
